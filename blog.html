        <p>On February 15, NJ Transit is implementing the largest service disruption in its history. For four weeks, as Amtrak connects the new Portal North Bridge to the Northeast Corridor, every rail line except the Atlantic City Rail Line will be affected. Roughly half of all trains between New Jersey and New York will be cut.</p>

        <p>Hundreds of thousands of commuters need to figure out, in a very short time, how their daily routine changes. That's a hard problem, and the official resources, while well-intentioned, don't always give you the clear, personalized answer you need at 6:30 in the morning when you're trying to get to work.</p>

        <p>Reroute NJ is an attempt to help.</p>

        <h2>What Reroute NJ does</h2>

        <p>We built three interactive tools (and counting) that help riders answer the questions they're actually asking:</p>

        <p><strong><a href="index.html">The Line Guide</a></strong> tells you exactly how your commute changes based on your line and station. Select your line, pick your station, and see a clear before-and-after comparison. It works for both directions of travel &mdash; morning commuters heading into NYC and evening commuters heading home to New Jersey.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="compare.html">The Commute Comparison Tool</a></strong> goes deeper. Pick your NJ station and your Manhattan destination, and we show you every route option side by side with visual time breakdowns. PATH vs. ferry vs. bus, ranked by total travel time, with cost and transfer details.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="coverage.html">The News Coverage Page</a></strong> curates reporting about the cutover from more than a dozen news sources across the region. Filter by source, line, direction, or category to find the coverage that matters to you.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="map.html">The Interactive Map</a></strong> shows the Portal Bridge location, all affected stations, and key transfer points on an OpenStreetMap base layer, so you can see the geography of the disruption at a glance.</p>

        <h2>Why it's built the way it is</h2>

        <p>Reroute NJ is a zero-build static site. Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no npm, no build step. You can fork the repo, edit a file, and deploy it on GitHub Pages in minutes.</p>

        <p>This is intentional. We wanted the project to be accessible to anyone who might want to contribute &mdash; journalists who can add articles to the coverage feed, community members who can report inaccuracies, and developers who can add features. Lowering the barrier to contribution is more important than using the latest technology.</p>

        <p>Everything is client-side. No server, no database, no API keys. The data is bundled as JSON and JavaScript objects. This means the site is fast, reliable, and works even if our servers (well, GitHub's servers) are under load.</p>

        <h2>For newsrooms and publishers</h2>

        <p>We built Reroute NJ to be shared, embedded, and republished. If you run a local news site, a community blog, or a transit advocacy page, we want you to use this tool.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Embed any tool</strong> on your website using our <a href="embed.html">embed code generator</a>. Just copy and paste an iframe.</li>
          <li><strong>Link to the tools</strong> from your Portal Bridge coverage. The URLs are permanent and have proper social meta tags for clean previews.</li>
          <li><strong>Fork the project</strong> and run your own branded version. The code is MIT-licensed. Change the colors, add your logo, deploy it on your own domain.</li>
          <li><strong>Add your coverage</strong> to our news feed. <a href="https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open a GitHub issue</a> or email joe@amditis.com with your article links.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We're especially interested in hearing from local publishers &mdash; TAPinto sites, Patch editors, community news outlets &mdash; who serve the specific towns affected by the cutover. Your local coverage is exactly what riders need, and we want to help amplify it.</p>

        <h2>How you can help</h2>

        <p>This is a community project and we need community help. Here's what you can do:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Share the tool.</strong> Text it to your train friends. Post it in your town's Facebook group. Tweet it. The more people who know about it, the better it works.</li>
          <li><strong>Report inaccuracies.</strong> If a travel time estimate is wrong, or a schedule change isn't reflected, <a href="https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let us know</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Suggest articles.</strong> Found good Portal Bridge coverage we haven't listed? <a href="https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Submit it</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Contribute code.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repo</a> is open. No build step, no framework knowledge required. If you can edit HTML, you can contribute.</li>
          <li><strong>Help with accessibility.</strong> We want the tool to work for everyone. Screen reader testing, WCAG compliance review, and keyboard navigation improvements are all welcome.</li>
          <li><strong>Translate.</strong> Help us make the tool available in Spanish and other languages spoken by NJ Transit riders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The bigger picture</h2>

        <p>The Portal Bridge cutover is painful, but it's ultimately a good thing. The 115-year-old Portal Bridge has been the worst bottleneck on the Northeast Corridor for decades. Every time it gets stuck opening for boat traffic, cascading delays affect hundreds of thousands of riders. The new Portal North Bridge eliminates that problem entirely.</p>

        <p>This four-week disruption is the price of progress. And when Phase 2 comes in the fall of 2026, we'll update Reroute NJ to cover that, too.</p>

        <p>In the meantime, we hope this tool makes the next month a little easier to navigate. Plan ahead, be patient with each other on the platforms, and remember: this is temporary.</p>
