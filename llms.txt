# Reroute NJ

> Free tools helping NJ Transit riders navigate the Portal North Bridge cutover (Feb 15 – Mar 15, 2026). Five interactive tools in 11 languages.

Reroute NJ provides real-time guidance for the roughly 300,000 daily NJ Transit rail commuters affected by the Portal North Bridge construction cutover. During this period, approximately 50% of NJ Transit trains between New Jersey and New York Penn Station are cut. All rail lines except the Atlantic City Rail Line are affected.

The cutover is caused by Amtrak transferring the first of two tracks from the 115-year-old Portal Bridge to the new Portal North Bridge over the Hackensack River in Kearny, NJ. This is Phase 1 of the Gateway Program milestone.

## Line-by-line impact summary

- **Montclair-Boonton Line**: Weekday trains diverted to Hoboken Terminal. Use PATH, ferry, or bus to reach Manhattan.
- **Morris & Essex Lines (Morristown, Gladstone)**: Weekday trains diverted to Hoboken Terminal. Same alternatives as Montclair-Boonton.
- **Northeast Corridor**: Reduced frequency. Trains still run to New York Penn Station but with fewer departures and possible delays at Secaucus.
- **North Jersey Coast Line**: Reduced frequency. Same route but fewer trains. Allow extra travel time.
- **Raritan Valley Line**: All one-seat rides to Penn Station NY suspended. All trains terminate at Newark Penn Station. Transfer to reduced-frequency NEC trains to reach Penn Station NY (adds 15-30 min).
