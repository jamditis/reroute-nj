    "date": "February 12, 2026",
    "intro_p1": "On February 15, NJ Transit is implementing the largest service disruption in its history. For four weeks, as Amtrak connects the new Portal North Bridge to the Northeast Corridor, every rail line except the Atlantic City Rail Line will be affected. Roughly half of all trains between New Jersey and New York will be cut.",
    "intro_p2": "Hundreds of thousands of commuters need to figure out, in a short time, how their daily routine changes. The official resources don't always give you the clear, personalized answer you need at 6:30 in the morning when you're trying to get to work.",
    "intro_p3": "Reroute NJ is an attempt to help.",
    "h2_tools": "Five tools, eleven languages",
    "tools_intro": "We built five interactive tools that help riders answer the questions they're asking:",
    "tool_line_guide": "<strong><a href=\"../index.html\">Line guide</a></strong> &mdash; Select your NJ Transit line and station to see exactly how your commute changes, what alternative routes are available, and what tickets you need. Works for both directions: morning commuters heading into NYC and evening commuters heading home.",
    "tool_compare": "<strong><a href=\"../compare.html\">Commute comparison</a></strong> &mdash; Pick your NJ station and your Manhattan destination, and see every route option side by side with visual time breakdowns. PATH vs. ferry vs. bus, ranked by total travel time, with cost and transfer details.",
    "tool_coverage": "<strong><a href=\"../coverage.html\">News coverage</a></strong> &mdash; Reporting about the cutover from local and regional news sources, updated throughout the day. Filter by source, line, direction, or category.",
    "tool_map": "<strong><a href=\"../map.html\">Interactive map</a></strong> &mdash; All five affected NJ Transit lines rendered on a map with station markers, key transfer points (Hoboken Terminal, Secaucus Junction, Newark Penn), and the Portal Bridge location over the Hackensack River.",
    "tool_embed": "<strong><a href=\"../embed.html\">Embed and share</a></strong> &mdash; Iframe embed codes, direct links, and instructions for newsrooms and publishers who want to republish any of these tools on their own sites.",
    "tools_languages": "Every tool page is available in 11 languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Korean, Portuguese, Gujarati, Hindi, Italian, Arabic, and Polish. These aren't machine-translated afterthoughts &mdash; each language has its own set of pages with translated navigation, labels, descriptions, and metadata. Station names, line names, and place names stay in English because that's what's on the signs.",
    "h2_built": "Why it's built the way it is",
    "built_p1": "Reroute NJ is a zero-build static site. Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no npm, no build step. You can fork the repo, edit a file, and deploy it on GitHub Pages in minutes.",
    "built_p2": "We wanted the project to be accessible to anyone who might want to contribute &mdash; journalists who can add articles to the coverage feed, community members who can report inaccuracies, and developers who can add features. Lowering the barrier to contribution matters more than using the latest technology.",
    "built_p3": "Everything is client-side. No server, no database, no API keys. The data is bundled as JSON and JavaScript objects. The site is fast and works even if GitHub's servers are under load.",
    "h2_newsrooms": "For newsrooms and publishers",
    "newsrooms_intro": "We built Reroute NJ to be shared, embedded, and republished. If you run a local news site, a community blog, or a transit advocacy page, we want you to use these tools.",
    "newsrooms_item1": "<strong>Embed any tool</strong> on your website using our <a href=\"../embed.html\">embed code generator</a>. Copy and paste an iframe.",
    "newsrooms_item2": "<strong>Link to the tools</strong> from your Portal Bridge coverage. The URLs are permanent and have social meta tags for clean previews.",
    "newsrooms_item3": "<strong>Fork the project</strong> and run your own branded version. The <a href=\"https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">code is MIT-licensed</a>. Change the colors, add your logo, deploy it on your own domain.",
    "newsrooms_item4": "<strong>Add your coverage</strong> to our <a href=\"../coverage.html\">news feed</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open a GitHub issue</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:amditisj@montclair.edu\">amditisj@montclair.edu</a> with your article links.",
    "newsrooms_outro": "We're interested in hearing from local publishers and community news outlets who serve the specific towns affected by the cutover. Your local coverage is what riders need, and we want to help get it in front of them.",
    "h2_help": "How you can help",
    "help_intro": "This is a community project and we need community help:",
    "help_item1": "<strong>Share the tool.</strong> Text it to your train friends. Post it in your town's Facebook group. The more people who know about it, the better it works.",
    "help_item2": "<strong>Report inaccuracies.</strong> If a travel time estimate is wrong, or a schedule change isn't reflected, <a href=\"https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj/issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">let us know</a>.",
    "help_item3": "<strong>Suggest articles.</strong> Found good Portal Bridge coverage we haven't listed? <a href=\"https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Submit it</a>.",
    "help_item4": "<strong>Contribute code.</strong> The <a href=\"https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub repo</a> is open. No build step, no framework knowledge required. If you can edit HTML, you can contribute.",
    "help_item5": "<strong>Help with accessibility.</strong> We want the tool to work for everyone. Screen reader testing, keyboard navigation improvements, and WCAG compliance review are all welcome.",
    "h2_bigger": "The bigger picture",
    "bigger_p1": "The Portal Bridge cutover is painful, but it's a good thing. The 115-year-old Portal Bridge has been the worst bottleneck on the Northeast Corridor for decades. Every time it gets stuck opening for boat traffic, cascading delays affect hundreds of thousands of riders. The new Portal North Bridge eliminates that problem.",
    "bigger_p2": "This four-week disruption is the price of progress. When Phase 2 comes in the fall of 2026, we'll update Reroute NJ to cover that, too.",
    "bigger_p3": "In the meantime, we hope these tools make the next month a little easier to navigate. Plan ahead, be patient with each other on the platforms, and remember: this is temporary.",

    "by_prefix": "By",
    "date": "February 13, 2026",
    "intro_p1": "The Portal Bridge cutover starts Saturday. If you cover transit in New Jersey &mdash; or if you run a community site, town Facebook page, or commuter forum &mdash; you can now put Reroute NJ tools directly on your website.",
    "intro_p2": "We just shipped a full embed system. Four output formats, a visual configurator that builds the embed code for you, and PNG export for social media and email newsletters. Everything is free to use.",
    "h2_formats": "Four ways to embed",
    "format_cards": "<strong>Info cards</strong> &mdash; Compact cards showing line impact, station details, or a full cutover summary. Drop one into an article sidebar or at the top of a liveblog. Three card types: line cards (one line's impact), station cards (one station's changes), and summary cards (all five lines at a glance).",
    "format_widgets": "<strong>Interactive widgets</strong> &mdash; Mini versions of the line guide, comparison tool, news feed, or map. These are live, working tools that readers can interact with inside your page. Pick a tool and it loads in an iframe sized to fit.",
    "format_full": "<strong>Full tool embeds</strong> &mdash; Any Reroute NJ page with the header and footer stripped out. Append <code>?embed=true</code> to any tool URL and it becomes embeddable. Good for dedicated cutover pages where you want to give readers the complete experience.",
    "format_script": "<strong>Script-tag embeds</strong> &mdash; A single <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. No iframe configuration needed. Add the div with data attributes for the embed type, line, and station, include the script, and it handles the rest. Works in CMSes where pasting iframe code is restricted.",
    "h2_configurator": "The configurator",
    "configurator_p1": "The <a href=\"../embed.html\">embed page</a> has a visual configurator that walks you through choosing your embed type, selecting the line and station, picking a theme (light or dark), and setting a custom accent color. It shows a live preview and gives you copy-paste code in all four formats.",
    "configurator_p2": "For info cards, you also get a <strong>Download PNG</strong> button that renders the card to a high-fidelity image. The PNG export uses Canvas rendering (not a screenshot), so text stays sharp at any size. Use it in newsletters, tweets, or print handouts.",
    "configurator_p3": "There's also a <strong>Download HTML</strong> option that gives you a self-contained file with all styles and data bundled in. No external dependencies, no network requests. Open it in a browser and it works offline.",
    "h2_customization": "Customization",
    "customization_intro": "Every embed supports two customization options:",
    "customization_theme": "<strong>Theme</strong> &mdash; Light or dark. Append <code>&amp;theme=dark</code> to any embed URL or set <code>data-theme=\"dark\"</code> on the script-tag div.",
    "customization_accent": "<strong>Accent color</strong> &mdash; Any hex color. Append <code>&amp;accent=FF6B35</code> or set <code>data-accent=\"FF6B35\"</code>. The accent applies to CTA buttons and color highlights.",
    "customization_outro": "Match the embed to your site's design without touching any code.",
    "h2_newsrooms": "For newsrooms",
    "newsrooms_p1": "We built this for you. The cutover will dominate transit coverage in the region for a month, and your readers need tools, not just articles. A line card in your sidebar tells a Montclair-Boonton commuter exactly what changes for them. A comparison widget lets a reader punch in their station and see every alternative route.",
    "newsrooms_p2": "The embed codes work on WordPress, Squarespace, Ghost, Substack (with the script-tag format), and any platform that accepts HTML. If you run into trouble embedding on your specific platform, <a href=\"https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open an issue</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:amditisj@montclair.edu\">amditisj@montclair.edu</a> and we'll help.",

  "about": {
    "tagline": "Our methodology",
    "hamburger_label": "About",
    "heading": "About our methodology",
    "intro": "Reroute NJ gives commuters specific guidance: which train to take, which ticket to buy, where to transfer. That information has to be right. People depend on it to get to work on time. Our approach prioritizes accuracy and accessibility over everything else.",
    "h2_translations": "How we produce translations",
    "translations_p1": "Every tool on this site is available in 11 languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Korean, Portuguese, Gujarati, Hindi, Italian, Arabic, and Polish. These languages were chosen because they are the most commonly spoken languages in New Jersey according to U.S. Census data.",
    "translations_p2": "Translations are produced with the help of AI language models and reviewed for natural phrasing and accuracy. Each language gets its own complete set of HTML pages with translated navigation, labels, headings, descriptions, accessibility text, and metadata. This is not a browser auto-translate overlay &mdash; every translated page is a standalone document that works without JavaScript if necessary.",
    "translations_rules": "We follow specific rules about what gets translated and what doesn't:",
    "li_stations": "<strong>Station names stay in English.</strong> \"Secaucus Junction\" is what's on the platform sign. Translating it would make it harder to find your train, not easier.",
    "li_lines": "<strong>Line names stay in English.</strong> \"Northeast Corridor\" and \"Montclair-Boonton Line\" are official NJ Transit designations. They appear in English on every schedule, app, and sign.",
    "li_places": "<strong>Place names stay in English.</strong> \"Hoboken Terminal,\" \"Penn Station New York,\" and \"Port Authority\" are proper nouns. Riders need to match what they see to what they read.",
    "li_everything_else": "<strong>Everything else is translated.</strong> Instructions, descriptions, labels, navigation, button text, accessibility announcements, error messages, and page metadata are all translated into each language.",
    "translations_fidelity": "This is a deliberate choice: fidelity to what riders actually see and hear at the station matters more than linguistic consistency. A Spanish-speaking commuter looking at their phone needs to read \"Tome el tren a Hoboken Terminal\" &mdash; not \"Tome el tren a Terminal de Hoboken\" &mdash; because the sign above the platform says \"Hoboken Terminal.\"",
    "h2_verification": "How we verify transit data",
    "verification_p1": "Every claim on this site &mdash; train counts, schedule changes, fare information, transfer directions &mdash; is traceable to an official source. We maintain a <a href=\"https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj/blob/main/data/sources.json\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">citation database</a> linking 28 specific claims to the official NJ Transit, Amtrak, PATH, and NY Waterway pages they come from.",
    "verification_intro": "Our verification process:",
    "li_official_sources": "<strong>Official sources first.</strong> Train counts, diversions, cross-honoring policies, and fare information come from <a href=\"https://www.njtransit.com/portalcutover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">njtransit.com/portalcutover</a> and official NJ Transit press releases. We do not use secondhand reporting as a primary source for transit data.",
    "li_automated_validation": "<strong>Automated validation.</strong> We run 698+ automated checks across 14 test suites that verify data structure, transit facts, cross-references between pages, HTML integrity, translation completeness, and accessibility compliance. These tests run before every change is published.",
    "li_automated_monitoring": "<strong>Automated monitoring.</strong> A scraper checks official NJ Transit and Amtrak pages four times a day for schedule or policy changes. When content changes, we review and update the site.",
    "li_source_attribution": "<strong>Source attribution on every page.</strong> Each line guide card and commute comparison result includes links to the official sources backing its claims, so riders can verify for themselves.",
    "li_open_source": "<strong>Open source.</strong> The entire codebase, all data files, and all test suites are <a href=\"https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">public on GitHub</a>. Anyone can inspect, challenge, or correct the data.",
    "h2_accessibility": "Our accessibility standards",
    "accessibility_p1": "Accessibility shaped every design decision from the start. The site meets WCAG 2.1 AA, the international standard for web accessibility.",
    "accessibility_intro": "What that means in practice:",
    "li_high_contrast": "<strong>High contrast mode.</strong> A toggle on every page switches to a high-contrast color scheme for riders with low vision. The setting persists across pages.",
    "li_simplified": "<strong>Simplified view.</strong> Strips decorative elements to reduce visual noise for riders who need fewer distractions.",
    "li_keyboard": "<strong>Keyboard navigation.</strong> Every control is reachable by keyboard. Focus indicators are visible. The tab order follows the visual layout.",
    "li_screenreader": "<strong>Screen reader support.</strong> ARIA labels, roles, and live regions let screen readers announce content changes. Skip-to-content links on every page.",
    "li_touch": "<strong>Touch targets.</strong> All buttons and controls are at least 44 pixels on mobile &mdash; large enough to tap accurately on a bumpy train.",
    "li_rtl": "<strong>Right-to-left support.</strong> The Arabic translation renders with proper right-to-left layout, text direction, and mirrored navigation.",
    "li_print": "<strong>Print stylesheets.</strong> Every page prints cleanly for riders who want a paper backup.",
    "h2_philosophy": "Why we built it this way",
    "philosophy_p1": "Reroute NJ is a plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript site. No frameworks, no build step, no server, no database. We chose this stack for reliability.",
    "philosophy_p2": "During the cutover, hundreds of thousands of commuters will need this information at peak hours. A static site served from a CDN handles traffic spikes without breaking. It works on old phones, slow connections, and every browser. There's no server to go down, no API to rate-limit, no dependency to break.",
    "philosophy_p3": "The tools are designed for someone checking their phone at 6:30 in the morning, standing on a platform, trying to figure out if their train still runs. That person needs a clear answer fast. They don't need animations, loading spinners, or a signup form. Every design decision starts from that scenario.",
    "h2_mistakes": "What we get wrong",
    "mistakes_p1": "We make mistakes. When we find them, we fix them and document the change. A few things to know:",
    "li_travel_times": "<strong>Travel time estimates are approximations.</strong> We use published schedules and average travel times, not live data. Actual times will vary, especially during the cutover when the system is under stress.",
    "li_schedules_change": "<strong>Schedules change.</strong> NJ Transit may adjust service during the cutover based on ridership patterns. We monitor for changes four times a day, but there may be a delay between an official update and our site reflecting it.",
    "li_translation_errors": "<strong>Translations may have errors.</strong> While we work to make translations natural and accurate, we rely on AI-assisted translation. If you find an error in any language, please <a href=\"https://github.com/jamditis/reroute-nj/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report it</a> and we'll fix it.",
    "mistakes_p2": "This is an independent project. We are not affiliated with NJ Transit, Amtrak, or any government agency. Always verify critical travel information at <a href=\"https://www.njtransit.com/portalcutover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">njtransit.com</a> before traveling.",

    "faq_a3": "During Feb 15 – Mar 15, 2026, Northeast Corridor trains continue to New York Penn Station but with reduced frequency due to single-track operations between Newark and Secaucus. Expect fewer departures and possible delays of 15-30 minutes during peak hours.",
    "faq_q4": "How does the Portal Bridge cutover affect the North Jersey Coast Line?",

    "faq_a5": "During Feb 15 – Mar 15, 2026, all Raritan Valley Line one-seat rides to Penn Station New York are suspended. All trains terminate at Newark Penn Station. Riders must transfer to a reduced-frequency Northeast Corridor train at Newark Penn to reach Penn Station NY, adding 15-30 minutes to the commute.",
    "faq_q6": "What is the Portal North Bridge cutover?",
    "faq_a6": "The Portal North Bridge cutover is a four-week period (Feb 15 – Mar 15, 2026) when Amtrak transfers the first track from the 115-year-old Portal Bridge to the new Portal North Bridge over the Hackensack River in Kearny, NJ. This requires single-track operations, reducing NJ Transit service by approximately 50% between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station.",
    "faq_q7": "How do I get from Hoboken Terminal to Manhattan during the cutover?",
    "faq_a7": "From Hoboken Terminal, you have three options to reach Manhattan: (1) PATH train to 33rd Street (~15 minutes, runs every 3-5 min during rush hour), (2) NY Waterway ferry to W. 39th Street (~10 minutes), or (3) Bus 126 to Port Authority Bus Terminal (~30-45 minutes via Lincoln Tunnel).",
