For four weeks, as Amtrak connects the new Portal North Bridge to the Northeast Corridor, every rail line except the Atlantic City Rail Line will be affected. Roughly half of all trains between New Jersey and New York will be cut.",
    "intro_p2": "Hundreds of thousands of commuters need to figure out, in a short time, how their daily routine changes. The official resources don't always give you the clear, personalized answer you need at 6:30 in the morning when you're trying to get to work.",
